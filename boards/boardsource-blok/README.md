# [boardsource-blok] - Board Support for the [Blok]

You should include this crate if you are writing code that you want to run on
a [Blok] - an RP2040 based controller, made by [Boardsource],
built for the keyboard community. 
This crate includes the [rp2040-hal], but also configures each pin of the
RP2040 chip according to how it is connected up on the Blok.
More Information about the pin layout at [Peg].

## Using

To use this crate, your `Cargo.toml` file should contain:

```toml
boardsource-blok = "0.1.0"
```

In your program, you will need to call `blok::Pins::new` to create
a new `Pins` structure. This will set up all the GPIOs for any on-board
devices. See the [examples](./examples) folder for more details.

## Examples

### General Instructions

To compile an example, clone the _rp-hal-boards_ repository and run:

```console
rp-hal-boards/boards/boardsource-blok $ cargo build --release --example <name>
```

You will get an ELF file called
`./target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/release/examples/<name>`, where the `target`
folder is located at the top of the _rp-hal-boards_ repository checkout. Normally
you would also need to specify `--target=thumbv6m-none-eabi` but when
building examples from this git repository, that is set as the default.

If you want to convert the ELF file to a UF2 and automatically copy it to the
USB drive exported by the RP2040 bootloader, simply boot your board into
bootloader mode and run:

```console
rp-hal-boards/boards/boardsource-blok $ cargo run --release --example <name>
```

If you get an error about not being able to find `elf2uf2-rs`, try:

```console
$ cargo install elf2uf2-rs
```
then try repeating the `cargo run` command above.

### From Scratch

To start a basic project from scratch, create a project using `cargo new project-name`. Within the
project directory, run `cargo add blok`, `cargo add cortex-m-rt`, and `cargo add panic-halt`. The
first command will add this HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer), the second is required for the `#[entry]` macro, and _panic-halt_ creates a simple panic function, which just halts.

You'll also need to copy the cargo config file from the [repo](https://github.com/rp-rs/rp-hal-boards/blob/main/.cargo/config). It specifies the target and optimizing flags to the linker. You'll also need to copy [_memory.x_](https://github.com/rp-rs/rp-hal-boards/blob/main/memory.x) to your project root. This file tells the linker the flash and RAM layout, so it won't clobber the bootloader or write to an out of bounds memory address. 

The simplest working example, which does nothing except loop forever, is:

```ignore
#![no_std]
#![no_main]
use blok::entry;
use panic_halt as _;
#[entry]
fn see_doesnt_have_to_be_called_main() -> ! {
  loop {}
}
```

It can be placed in _/src/main.rs_. 

You can use `cargo run` to compile and install it. 
**Note**: You won't see any activity since this program does nothing. You can use the examples provided
to add more functionality. 
### [blok_rainbow](./examples/blok_rainbow.rs)

Runs a rainbow-effect color wheel on the on-board neopixel.

### [blok_reset_to_usb_boot](./examples/blok_reset_to_usb_boot.rs)

Resets the Blok after 10 seconds to usb boot mode.

### [blok_usb_keyboard_input](./examples/blok_usb_keyboard_input.rs)

Demonstrates emulating a USB Human Input Device (HID) Keyboard. The keyboard
will type "HELLO" five times.

### [blok_usb_serial](./examples/blok_usb_serial.rs)

Demonstrates creating a USB Serial device.
The device will loop 10 times, where on each loop the current loop number is printed.
If the device reads "stop", the blok will reset to usb boot mode.
